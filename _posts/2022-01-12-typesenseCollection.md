Collection is simply a group of related documents in Typesense. In a relational database, a collection is roughly equivalent to a table.To create a collection we must first create a Collection, give it a name, and describe the fields that will be indexed from our Documents before we can add them to Typesense. This definition is referred to as the collection's schema, which is simply a fancy way of describing the fields (and their data types) in your documents.

Defining a collection's "schema" can be compared to defining "types" in a strongly-typed programming language like Typescript, C, Java, Dart, Rust, and so on. This ensures that the documents you add to your collection have consistent data types and are validated, preventing a whole slew of errors that can occur when data types are mismatched or inconsistent across documents.

A schema can be specified in two ways:

- Typesense can either pre-define all of the fields to be indexed from your documents, or it can detect your fields and data types based on the documents you index.
- The simplest option is with auto schema detection, which eliminates the need to define an explicit schema. However, if you require more fine-grained control and/or validation, you should use with pre-defined schema detection, or even combine the two.
