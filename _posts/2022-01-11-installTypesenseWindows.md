##### Windows (WSL)(opens new window)

```bash
wsl
wget https://dl.typesense.org/releases/0.22.1/typesense-server-0.22.1-amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./typesense-server-0.22.1-amd64.deb
```

Keep in mind that after installing the typesense-server package, the "installed typesense-server package post-installation script subprocess returned error exit status 1" message will appear. Ignore this message; <mark>apt list --installed | grep typesense</mark> will show that the installation was successful.
