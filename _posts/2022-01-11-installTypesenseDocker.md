Docker is a containerization platform that is free and open source. It allows developers to package applications into containers, which are standardized executable components that combine application source code with the OS libraries and dependencies needed to run that code in any environment. Containers make distributing distributed applications easier, and they're becoming more popular as companies move to cloud-native development and hybrid cloud environments.

##### Docker Image

Let's start with a basic understanding of containers before moving on to the utility of Docker.A container is a standard software unit that packages code and all of its dependencies so that an application can run quickly and reliably in different computing environments.During the development phase, this tool is extremely useful. Because there are so many developers involved in the process, setting up the environment to run the project can be a daunting task, especially since each project has its own set of dependencies and versions.

A Docker container image is a small, standalone software package that contains everything needed to run an application, including code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. At runtime, container images become containers, and when Docker containers run on Docker Engine, images become containers.
