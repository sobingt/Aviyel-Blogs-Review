You'll learn how to use Typesense with PHP applications in this tutorial. As an example, we'll use a Laravel application, but you can use any PHP codebase as long as you know what you're doing.

#### Typesense in Action

Before we get started programming the app, let's take a look at how Typesense works. Typesense is written in C++ and comes as a pre-compiled application, as previously stated. You can download the application and run it as a server on your server or local machine. The Typesense server works in the same way as any other web server, with a user-friendly REST API interface. HTTP requests are used to communicate with this server. Consider the following scenario: you run an online bookstore and you're looking for a book called Clean Code. You can do so by running the following CURL command:

```bash
curl -H "X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: ${TYPESENSE_API_KEY}" \
"${TYPESENSE_HOST}/
collections/books/documents/search?q=clean+code&query_by=title"
```
